# harbour_frontend

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started with development

Using VScode for your IDE is highly recommended.

If you're using VScode, you should download the following extensions:
- Dart (extension id is Dart-Code.dart-code)
- Flutter (extension id is Dart-Code.flutter)
- Awesome Flutter Snippets (extension id is Nash.awesome-flutter-snippets)

To run the application, open a new terminal and type "flutter run".
If you make changes to source code, you can type "r" into the terminal to do a hot reload.
